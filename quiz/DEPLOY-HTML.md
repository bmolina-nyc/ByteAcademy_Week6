## Phase 1 Quiz 1

* Create a flask application that serves a static html file at the `/` route or
at the `/static/index.html`

* The static html file should include a two column layout, a title, and at 
least one link

* Deploy it to a new DigitalOcean server

* If you only get as far as serving the page on the *server's* (not the local)
port 5000 you pass, but complete the deployment to nginx port 80 after the
time is over.
